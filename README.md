# Segmentation-and-Clustering-of-Guayaquil-s-Parishes
Important hotel companies from abroad, wish to perform a geo-statistical analysis of urban parishes in the city of Guayaquil. Guayaquil is the largest city in Ecuador and occupies a primary place in the national economy. For this, it will use the Foursquare platform, to measure consumption trends in each area, such as: what types of places exist (parks, shopping centers, restaurants, etc.), which of these places are well attended, provided by hotels in the area, etc. For this, the analyst who was hired by these hotel companies, obtained relevant information from each parish, and it turns out that the parishes of the city center, are very close. While the parishes of the north and east, are well separated. The information obtained refers to the names, geographical coordinates, neighborhoods and commercial places of each parish. With this information, we will study if the parishes are grouped, by commercial trends, without taking into account the distance between them.
